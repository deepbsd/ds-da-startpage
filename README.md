# Start Page for Data Science and Data Analytics Wed Night Classes at TGS

The procedure for getting students started on Wed nights is rather complex.  They invariably take a
long time to get it done, thus depriving themselves of their best outcomes.  I created this 
start page to help streamline the tasks they must accomplish so they can participate freely
in the class coding projects.
